# Scikit-Learn-for-Classification

In this project, we will build and train classifier models using Scikit-Learn library. Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library developed for python. Scikit-learn offers several algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.

# PROJECT STRUCTURE:
